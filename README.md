## Intro

Here is a monorepository that contains packages that allow you to easily split your Redux store into separate
parts (`eggs`), and then dynamically add and remove them when you need it. This set of packages will allow you to reduce
the size of your Redux store and the first-load JavaScript by adding only the currently needed reducers and middlewares.
You no longer have to add all reducers and middlewares at once when creating your Redux store. If you need some kind of
reducer or middleware, you can dynamically add these constructs at runtime exactly when your application requires it.
You will be able to create reusable constructs with reducers and middlewares so that you can easily connect them in
different parts of your application. Moreover, if you need reusable parts of the Redux store in different projects, you
can also create separate reusable packages and use them in your projects.

If you are familiar with [Redux Dynamic Modules](https://github.com/microsoft/redux-dynamic-modules), then most likely
you know what is going on here.
